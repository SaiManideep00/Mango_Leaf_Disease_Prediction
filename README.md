# Mango_Leaf_Disease_Prediction
This project is about mango leaf disease prediction. There are leaf images which are divided into 8 categories of diseases. Our task is to build a classifier and predict the disease of the leaf image. To achieve this we used Convolutional Neural Network and K Nearest Neighbors algorithms.

Steps to run:

This code can be run on jupyter notebook or google colab.
Download the code file from this repository
Download the dataset from kaggle. Use the link https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aryashah2k/mango-leaf-disease-dataset
Give the path of the dataset in your local machine in the code if use jupyter , Or upload this dataset to google drive and mount it if you use colab.
The running instructions are so simple. Just run each cell of the code and you will see the output
